### Introduction

Brief introduction to the repository and its purpose.

### Coding Standards and Style Guides

#### PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code

Python Enhancement Proposal 8, commonly known as PEP 8, is the style guide for writing clean and readable Python code. Adhering to PEP 8 enhances code readability and consistency, which are crucial for individual developers and teams. Below are some of the key points covered in PEP 8:

##### 1. Indentation
   - Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
   - Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically, or using a hanging indent.

##### 2. Maximum Line Length
   - Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters for code.
   - For flowing long text (like comments), the limit is 72 characters.

##### 3. Blank Lines
   - Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.

##### 4. Imports
   - Imports should usually be on separate lines.
   - Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings.

##### 5. Whitespace in Expressions and Statements
   - Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:
     - Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces.
     - Between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis.
     - Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon.

##### 6. Comments
   - Comments should be complete sentences.
   - Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period.

##### 7. Naming Conventions
   - Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
   - Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.

##### 8. Programming Recommendations
   - Code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other implementations of Python.
   - Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier.

##### 9. String Quotes
   - In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same. PEP 8 does not make a recommendation for this; pick a rule and stick to it.

#### Why is PEP 8 Important?

- **Readability**: Python's philosophy emphasizes readability and simplicity. PEP 8 provides a set of rules that help in maintaining a consistent and readable code style.
- **Consistency**: Following PEP 8 ensures that Python code looks and behaves similarly across diverse projects. This consistency is vital when multiple people are working on the same project.
- **Quality Assurance**: Adherence to PEP 8 is often considered a hallmark of quality Python code. It demonstrates attention to detail and a focus on quality.

#### Tools for PEP 8 Compliance

Several tools can help ensure PEP 8 compliance:
- **Flake8**: A tool that checks the compliance of your code with PEP 8.
- **Black**: An uncompromising Python code formatter that takes your code and reformats it in place to adhere to PEP 8.
- **pylint**: A tool that looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, and sniffs for some code smells.
